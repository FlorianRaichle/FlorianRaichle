A theme for the static website builder [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
It is based on an existing [theme](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) and was customized for my needs and to explore the possibilities of Hugo and tailwind.
The code can be found [here](https://github.com/FlorianRaichle/FlorianRaichle).
