A theme for the static website builder [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
It is based on an existing [theme](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) but refactored, the css rewritten using tailwind and customized for my needs to explore the possibilities of Hugo and tailwind.

## How to use the theme
The code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/FlorianRaichle/FlorianRaichle).

Follow the hugo's [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and clone the theme from ``https://github.com/FlorianRaichle/my-hugo-profile.git``.
Build on the example page in the ``website`` folder inside the theme.

If you just want to use the theme without making any changes you can just build the site with ``hugo server``.
If you want to change the tamplate you need to download node.js to be able to rebuild with tailwind.
