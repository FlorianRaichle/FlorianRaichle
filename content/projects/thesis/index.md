Abstract
========

To simulate adsorption in industrial applications and gain more insight
into the coupling of fluid flow and adsorption performance, adsorption
models at larger scales than just single particles are needed. In this
thesis a model of the adsorption on moving particles is applied to the
lattice Boltzmann method using an Euler-Euler approach. The adsorption
model is based on mass transfer as described by the linear driving force
model and can incorporate several mass transfer mechanisms, such as film
diffusion, surface diffusion and pore diffusion. Particles, their
adsorbate loading, and the solute are described by the advection
diffusion equation with an adsorption source term.

Using analytical solutions for a batch and fixed bed reactor the model
and its coupling with the fluid is validated. Grid studies are conducted
to show the convergence of the model. The applicability of the model to
complex flow problems is demonstrated in a static mixer with moving
particles.
