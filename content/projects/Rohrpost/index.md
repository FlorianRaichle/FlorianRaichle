## Technical Highlights
- Instant Sync using Google Firebase
- Cross Platform through Flutter

Using Firebase as a backend enabled easy serverless sync with great compatibility with flutter resulting in responsive design.
Functionality like search uses the power of declarative programming in flutter, which in general made building the UI very easy and a lot of fun.
