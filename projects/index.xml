It is based on an existing theme and was customized for my needs and to explore the possibilities of Hugo and tailwind. The code can be found here.</description></item><item><title>Rohrpost</title><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/rohrpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/rohrpost/</guid><description>If you have a link, snippet of text or an image you just want to get from one device to another, use Rohrpost. It syncs instantly between all of your devices. Technical Highlights Instant Sync using Google Firebase Cross Platform through Flutter Using Firebase as a backend enabled easy serverless sync with great compatibility with flutter resulting in responsive design. Functionality like search uses the power of declarative programming in flutter, which in general made building the UI very easy and a lot of fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
