It is based on an existing theme but refactored, the css rewritten using tailwind and customized for my needs to explore the possibilities of Hugo and tailwind.
How to use the theme The code can be found on my github.
Follow the hugo&amp;rsquo;s quick start guide and clone the theme from https://github.com/FlorianRaichle/my-hugo-profile.git. Build on the example page in the website folder inside the theme.</description></item><item><title>Rohrpost</title><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/rohrpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/rohrpost/</guid><description>If you have a link, snippet of text or an image you just want to get from one device to another, use Rohrpost. It syncs instantly between all of your devices. The goal was to find a simple starter project to have a go at app development. I was using Windows and iOS and wanted an easy way to share small amounts of data between the two operating systems, without having to email myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
