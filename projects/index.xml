Abstract To simulate adsorption in industrial applications and gain more insight into the coupling of fluid flow and adsorption performance, adsorption models at larger scales than just single particles are needed. In this thesis a model of the adsorption on moving particles is applied to the lattice Boltzmann method using an Euler-Euler approach.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Theme</title><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/theme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/theme/</guid><description>A theme for the static website builder Hugo using tailwindcss and alpine.js.

In this thesis a model of the adsorption on moving particles is applied to the lattice Boltzmann method using an Euler-Euler approach. The adsorption model is based on mass transfer as described by the linear driving force model and can incorporate several mass transfer mechanisms, such as film diffusion, surface diffusion and pore diffusion.</description></item></channel></rss>
