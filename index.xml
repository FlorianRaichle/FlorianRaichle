Abstract To simulate adsorption in industrial applications and gain more insight into the coupling of fluid flow and adsorption performance, adsorption models at larger scales than just single particles are needed. In this thesis a model of the adsorption on moving particles is applied to the lattice Boltzmann method using an Euler-Euler approach.</description></item><item><title>Prose</title><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/prose/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 11:10:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/prose/</guid><description>A Test with Tailwind Prose Classes With the new @tailwindcss/typography module I can add prose modifiers that will render to the output HTML. This allows you to style HTML tags individually with i.e. prose-h*:text-color-*00
this is a H1 header this is a H2 header this is a H3 header this is a H4 header You can change link colors too and define hover with prose prose-a:text-pink-700 hover:prose-a:text-cyan-700 - example: gohugo.io</description></item><item><title/><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/readme/</guid><description>Hugo &amp;amp; Tailwind-3.0 A barebone Hugo &amp;amp; Tailwind CSS 3.0 starter kit
Download and install in VS Code
To start developing: npm run start
To generate the site HTML: npm run build
npm run start will run two command parallel: npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/style.css &amp;ndash;watch
and hugo server
Note: When you start npm run start a style.css must exist - or you get an error! Just do a Ctrl+C and run npm run start - even though you got an error but a style was written anyway and 2nd time round it should start fine.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Theme</title><link>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/theme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FlorianRaichle.github.io/projects/theme/</guid><description>A theme for the static website builder Hugo using tailwindcss and alpine.js.

In this thesis a model of the adsorption on moving particles is applied to the lattice Boltzmann method using an Euler-Euler approach. The adsorption model is based on mass transfer as described by the linear driving force model and can incorporate several mass transfer mechanisms, such as film diffusion, surface diffusion and pore diffusion.</description></item></channel></rss>
